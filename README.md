### Instructions To Run Code

The code to run is in the `main.ipynb` file. To run the code, run all cells starting from the first cell. If using VS Code IDE, there should be a 'Run All' button at the top. There are screenshot images of the evaluation results for each part under the corresponding code in the file. 

The part 4 model is in the `second_order_viterbi` function on the same file, we attempted to use second-order HMM for part 4.
The output file for part 4 is in `test.p4.out`.
